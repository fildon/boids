[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/fildon/boids/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/fildon/boids?branch=master)

Boids is an implementation of an artificial life program originally developed in the 1980s. 

The concept is simple, flocking can be simulated with just three fundamental rules:
- Separation (avoid crashing into other birds)
- Alignment (travel in the same direction as nearby birds)
- Cohesion (get close to nearby birds)
